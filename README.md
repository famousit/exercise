# Exercise

You have a log file (log.txt) where each line represents an event in the format:
```
[TIMESTAMP] EVENT_TYPE - MESSAGE
```

Example: 
```
[2025-05-26 10:00:00] INFO - Started processing job 123
[2025-05-26 10:01:00] ERROR - Failed to process job 123
[2025-05-26 10:02:00] INFO - Retried job 123
```

Your task is to implement and improve a log file parser. Some functions are scaffolded but incomplete. You'll need to fill them in or optimize them.
